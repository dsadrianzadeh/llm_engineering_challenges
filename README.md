# LLM Engineering Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges presented in the Udemy course **LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents**. The challenges can be found in the original repository: [ed-donner/llm_engineering](https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering).

The repository is organized into the following structure:

- **week01**: Contains four Jupyter Notebook (**.ipynb**) files.
- **week02** to **week08**: Currently empty folders that will be filled with future challenges.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages.
