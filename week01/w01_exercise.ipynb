By modifying the dataset and feature selection, you can apply this model to different problems where linear relationships between variables are expected."

    "    *   `sklearn`: We'll use it for building a simple linear regression model. Specifically, it has modules for different algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, etc.\n",

    "### Reading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is reading data from a CSV file named 'data.csv'. We're using the pandas library to read this file into our Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The `read_csv()` function in pandas reads an excel or csv file. Then prints out header names of that dataframe.\n",
    "    To use it properly, one must ensure that your python environment can locate the data.csv file. One way is by giving full path while importing like so:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "df = pandas.read_csv(\"/path/to/data.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets up our data for training our model. The `LinearRegression()` function takes in an arbitrary number of features but should take only two (one dependent and once independent variable). Using a simple equation, it tries to make prediction about \"y\" given any combination of the values for \"X\". \n",

    "### Training Model\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "regr.fit(X, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Getting Result\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(regr.coef_)\n",
    "```\n",
    " The print statements above is called the output. In the code `regr.coef_`, 'coef' refers to coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Coefficient or the slope in linear regression model.\n",
    "    It estimates how extreme (or large) the relationship between variable \"X\", and variable y is.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used while calculating Y according to formula :Y = aX + b\n",
    "   *a* is independent coefficient or simply coefficient .\n",
    "     *b* is dependent coefficient or constant value .\n",
